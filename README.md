## Background

Our group will develop a supervised machine learning model to predict student success in higher education using a dataset consisting of academic, demographic, and socio-economic factors. Our dataset was sourced from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success) and is created from several disjoint databases related to students enrolled in various undergraduate degrees (agronomy, design, education, nursing, journalism, management, social service, and technologies). The dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment and the students' academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters.The classification will predict students that will be successful or dropout. Our model will aim to provide valuable insights to support interventions for at-risk students and improve overall retention and academic outcome. 

* Success: Students who graduated or finished their course.

* Drop out: Students who did not finish the entirety of their course, failed out, left early, or did not graduate for any other reason.
